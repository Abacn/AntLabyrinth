# Caging and Transport in Simple Disordered Systems

Simulation codes for the high-dimensional model disordered systems, including the lattice percolation, random Lorentz gas. and Mari-Kurchan/Mari-Krzakala-Kurchan model.

Content of programs:

1. Lattice percolation numerics and simulation, see [LatticePercolation](LatticePercolation/README.md).
2. Random Lorentz gas simulations, see [RLG](RLG/README.md).
3. Hard spheres/MK/MKK Model, see [MKKModel](MKK/README.md).
